# Ludo AI #
## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to compare several approaches in the area of artificial intelligence under the constrained enviroment of a ludo game. The ludo game variant chosen is the german version 'Mensch ärgere dich nicht !' (coarsly translation: 'Don't get bothered !').
## Project ##
The project itself is part of the lecture Artficial Intelligence (AI) of the University of Mannheim (Germany).
## Documentation ##
Further documentation will be available as soon as we get used to our agile development criteria. Just kidding, there will be a comprehensive documentation of both the programm and the outcome. Also have a look into our wiki.
## Contribution ##
You will be able to contribute your own player and see how it competes with others. How this works, will be described in the documentation part. So keep coming back.
